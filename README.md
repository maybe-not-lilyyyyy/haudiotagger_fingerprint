## Why haudiotagger_fingerprint?

Filenames lie and tags go missing — but the audio doesn't. This package
fingerprints **what a recording sounds like**, so this:

```text
Song A.mp3
song_copy.mp3
01 - Song A.mp3
Song A (Remastered).mp3
```

can be compared by content instead of by name.

### Highlights

- 🧬 Chromaprint-compatible perceptual fingerprints (same algorithm as fpcalc/AcoustID)
- 🎵 MP3, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, AIFF, M4A/AAC/ALAC
- 🌍 Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows & Web
- 🦀 100% pure Rust — no C dependencies, builds everywhere including WASM
- 📦 Separate lightweight package — zero cost unless you depend on it

---

## Installation

Add haudiotagger_fingerprint to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  haudiotagger_fingerprint: ^0.1.4
```

Or install it from the command line:

```bash
flutter pub add haudiotagger_fingerprint
```

---

## Quick Start

### Fingerprint a file

```dart
import 'package:haudiotagger_fingerprint/haudiotagger_fingerprint.dart';

// Decodes the full stream; tags, filenames, and containers are ignored.
final a = await HaudioFingerprint.fingerprint('Song A.mp3');
final b = await HaudioFingerprint.fingerprint('song_copy.mp3');

print(a.durationSecs);
```

### Compare two fingerprints

```dart
// 1.0 is (near-)identical audio, 0.0 is unrelated.
final score = await HaudioFingerprint.similarity(a, b);
print(score); // 1.0

// Or as a method:
print(await a.similarityTo(b));
```

### Fingerprint bytes (Web)

```dart
final fp = await HaudioFingerprint.fingerprintFromBytes(bytes);
```

### Unified API with haudiotagger

With both packages installed, fingerprinting is also available through
`Haudiotagger` — no extra imports or init calls. This package
self-registers as the backend at app startup:

```dart
import 'package:haudiotagger/haudiotagger.dart';

final fp = await Haudiotagger.fingerprint('Song A.mp3');
final score = await Haudiotagger.similarity(a, b);
```

Without this package installed, those calls throw a `StateError` telling
you to add it. Requires `haudiotagger ^2.2.0`.

### Finding duplicates

Group files with `similarity >= 0.8` as the same recording, then use each
file's metadata (title/artist/duration) to pick which copy to keep.

## Score interpretation

| Score | Meaning |
|:-----:|---------|
| `1.0` | Identical audio (copies, renames) |
| `> 0.8` | Same recording, different encode/container |
| `~0.0` | Unrelated audio |

---

## Supported formats (decoding)

| Format | Fingerprint |
|:------:|:-----------:|
| **MP3** | ✅ |
| **FLAC** | ✅ |
| **Ogg Vorbis** | ✅ |
| **WAV** | ✅ |
| **AIFF** | ✅ |
| **M4A / AAC / ALAC** | ✅ |
| **Opus, APE, WavPack, Musepack** | ❌ (no pure-Rust decoder) |

---

## Platform support

| Platform | Support |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Android | ✅ |
| iOS | ✅ |
| Linux | ✅ |
| macOS | ✅ |
| Windows | ✅ |
| Web | ✅ |

The Web implementation decodes and fingerprints fully in-browser via
WebAssembly. Large files are CPU-heavy; prefer short clips or native
for bulk library scans.

---

## Requirements

- Flutter `>= 3.0.0`
- Dart SDK `>= 3.6.0`
